  \subsection{Angular correction}

  Our straws don't actually measure U and V coordinates directly, but instead measure the distance of closest approach radii deriving from measured hit times. In order to utilize the minimization procedure on measured track parameters these radii must first be converted to U and V parameters, and similarly for the U and V errors. (Note that a future Kalman filter will not be subject to this disadvantage.) This is done in the calcMeasuredParams method at the bottom of the GeaneParamUtils class. These conversion corrections will be dependent on the angle of the track, so it's imporant to note that during each successive iteration, the ``measured'' parameters are adjusted by the latest ``predicted'' momenta. It was found that for the error correction, a simple straight line correction was sufficient for ideal results. For the position correction, it was found that a constant field correction for curved tracks was sufficient.

  To calculate these corrections, first the momentum perpendicular to the straw measurement axis can be ignored since it won't affect the U or V value. Because the positron tracks curve in only one direction through the tracker, one needs to calculate the correction depending on whether the track went to the left or right side of the wire. See Figure \ref{fig:angularCorrection} for a pictorial representation of the problem. The calculation of the right side correction follows, with the left side correction being calculated in a similar manner.

	\begin{figure}[]
	\caption{Shown here is a positron passing through a straw. The desire is to convert the measured parameter d into a U or V position, which can be done by approximating the particle trajectory as a circle in a constant magnetic field over the course of the straw and using trigonometry. Sizes and angles are exaggerated.}

  To solve for the measured U (or V) value, we can use the equation:
	\begin{align}
		(r+d)^{2} = r^{2}+u^{2}-2ru\cos(90+\theta),
	\end{align}
  where the 90 degrees is approximate for large curvature of tracks. The angle $\theta$ can be determined from 
	\begin{align}
		\hat{z_{\parallel}} \cdot \hat{p_{\parallel}} = \cos{\theta}, \hspace{.1cm} \theta = \cos^{-1}{\frac{p_{\parallel}}{p}}, 
	\end{align}
  where $p_{\parallel}$ is the positron momentum parallel to the $z_{\parallel}$ axis at the wire plane and can be determined within the code. (The $z_{\parallel}$ axis simply stands for the axis perpendicular to the straw and parallel to the U measurement axis, but opposite in direction. At the end this calculated U value will simply be added or subtracted to the wire center U position depending on which side of the wire the positron travelled.) Using some trig identities and solving for u gives
	\begin{align}
		u = -r\sqrt{1-(\frac{p_{\parallel}}{p})^{2}} + \sqrt{d^{2} + 2dr + r^{2}(1-(\frac{p_{\parallel}}{p})^{2})},
	\end{align}
  for the right side correction, and 
	\begin{align}
		u = +r\sqrt{1-(\frac{p_{\parallel}}{p})^{2}} - \sqrt{d^{2} + 2dr + r^{2}(1-(\frac{p_{\parallel}}{p})^{2})},
	\end{align}
  for the left side correction. (Corrections to v are identical.) The radius of the particle circle can be calculated from the circular momentum and magnetic field at the predicted hit position. The straightline correction is done simply using the Pythagorean theorem in a simpler manner, with the correction to the errors then being
	\begin{align}
		\sigma_{uv}' = \frac{\sigma_{uv}}{\sqrt{1-(\frac{p_{\parallel}}{p})^{2}}}.
	\end{align}


\subsection{Matrix Transformation}
\label{sec:MatTransf}

  Transport matrices are accumulated as
      \begin{align} %\label{eq:nolabel}
        T_{mn} = T_{mk}T_{kn},
      \end{align}
  where the indices can stand for either plane numbers or step numbers, and converted by 
      \begin{align} %\label{eq:nolabel}
        T_{mn,s} = A_{m} T_{mn,f} A_{n}^{-1},
      \end{align}     
  where the indices s and f stand for the surface and free trajectory states respectively, and A is the Jacobian transformation from the free state to the surface state on a particular plane m or n. See \cite{jacob} for the calculation of these Jacobians. The error matrices in the surface state can be grabbed directly from the Geant code unlike the transport matrices, or if necessary can be converted as
      \begin{align} %\label{eq:nolabel}
        \sigma_{m,s} = A_{m} \sigma_{m,f} A_{m}^{-1}.
      \end{align}
