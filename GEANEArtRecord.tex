\caption{GEANEArtRecord.hh active variables. This is subject to change. GEANEArtRecord contains vectors of variables on planes, as well as larger objects containing information about the whole track. Note that Eigen matrix objects cannot be stored into art data products. For this reason, and for minimal code changes, it was decided to add a data object for each Eigen member, made up of vectors with the word ``Data'' tagged at the end. The data objects are saved when creating GEANEArtRecords using a utils file. In analyzers accessing the GEANEArtRecords, these data objects are then swapped into the Eigen objects using the same utils file.}

enum GeaneHitSide \\ 
\texitit{An enum for which side of the wire the track hit is guessed or calculated to have passed. Options are gLeft, gRight, gCenter, gNA_side, and gUnknown.
