\begin{abstract}

    In this document I will detail the concepts and mathematics of GEANE track fitting, as well as it's implementation in the gm2 simulation framework for the Muon g-2 Experiment at Fermilab. I will also detail the pecularities and intricacies of the code. This is done both for documentation purposes as well as a precursor to sections of my future thesis. This document assumes some familiarity with art on part of the reader, though such knowledge is not necessary for many sections. Note that the tracking code and framework is in constant development, so the details contained here within may be outdated at time of reading.

\section{Introduction}

  The Muon g-2 Experiment at Fermilab will use tracking detectors in order to measure positron trajectories for the purpose of determining the beam distribution and its characteristics, both for the final $\omega_{a}$ result and for general beam diagnostics. A fraction of positrons originating from decaying muons will pass through the trackers. By fitting these tracks and extrapolating back to the average decay point, the beam can be characerized in a non-destructive fashion. The tracking can be done independently from the calorimeters in order to cross-check, or combined with them in order to provide the muon distribution that the calorimeters see for the direct $\omega_{a}$ calculation. It is arguable that this is the most important duty of the trackers. (Note that the integration of the two detector systems in the code has not been initiated.) It is also worth noting that there is a large percentage of tracks that hit the calorimeters hit zero or a small number of tracking modules, which this fitting code is not capable of handling.

  Each tracker module consists of 4 layers of 32 straws with a stereo angle of 7.5 degrees, the first two ``U'' layers oriented with the tops of the straws at a greater radial position, and the second two ``V'' layers oriented with the bottoms of the straws at a greater radial position. A tracking module is shown in Figure \ref{fig:tracker}. There are 3 tracker stations located at the 0, 12th, and 18th sections of the ring, counting clockwise from the top most point of the ring where the inflector resides. (Station 18 has been installed at time of writing, with station 0 planned for the fall. Station 12 is slated for the future sometime.) Each station consists of 8 tracking modules arranged in a staircase pattern that follows the curvature of the ring as seen in Figure \ref{fig:staircase}. Further hardware and electronics information regarding the trackers will be omitted in this document.

\begin{figure}[]
\caption{Shown is a picture of one of the many tracking modules used in the Muon g-2 experiment. The first layer of straws with a stereo angle of 7.5 degrees can be seen, with the other 3 straw layers hiding behind it. The beam direction is roughly into the page in this picture, and this view is what the decay positrons will see. Picture provided by James.}

\end{figure}


  Because of the proximity of the trackers to the muon beam, they will lie within a region of varying field. The radial field of the trackers rises from 0 Tesla at the outer ends to roughly .3 Tesla at the inner top and bottom ends, and the vertical field drops approximately 50\% from the storage dipole field of 1.451 Tesla. Shown in Figures \ref{fig:operaBy} and \ref{fig:operaBx} is the location of the tracker with respect to the horizontal and vertical fields respectively. If one thing can be said to be special to g-2 when it comes to tracking it is these large field gradients over the tracking detector region and several meter long extrapolation distance back to the muon decay point. This is one of the main motivations for using the Geane (Geometry and Error Propagation) fitting algorithm and routines, which has direct access to the field.

The black box shows the rough location of the tracker with respect to the field (size exaggerated slightly). It can be seen that there is a large inhomogeneity within the tracker space, goring from left to right.}

It can be seen that there is a large homogeneity at the inner upper and lower ends compared to the right center. The shape of the pole pieces and tips can readily be seen.}

  The Geane fitting routines originated in Fortran with the EMC collaboration, and was used in the precursor E821 experiment as well as the PANDA experiment with some success. (cite stuff here?) (There might be some other instances of its use as well.) The core error propagation routines were at some point added to Geant4 under the error\_propagation directory which is included in all default installs. The tracking code strengths lie with its direct implementation and access to the Geant4 geometry and field, and its ability to handle the field inhomogeneties. The Geane algorithm code which makes use of the Geant4 error\_propagation routines follows the structure of \cite{geanemanual} and is detailed in the Formalism section in this paper. It is a relatively straight forward least squares global $\chi^{2}$ minimization algorithm.

\section{In the gm2 Framework}

  At the time of writing, the user should check out the artg4, gm2dataproducts, gm2geom, gm2ringsim, gm2tracker, and gm2utils packages of the gm2 repository, and be on the feature/trackDevelop branch in all instances. Every so often these branches are merged with the main develop branches, where the tracking code will work but might not have the latest code changes. In the future when the track reconstruction code is in a more final state, I imagine that the main g-2 analyses will all be based on particular versions of the develop branches.

  \subsection{Event Generation, Geometry, and Material}

    While not a direct part of the reconstruction and fitting code, there is relevant information with respect to event generation in the simulation upon which the reconstruction acts. Event generation before fitting is done using the mdc fcl files in gm2ringsim using the main simulation, where one should also include the tracker dummy plane geometry for truth comparison with the Geane fitting. These are built in the TrackerDummyPlane\_service and associated geometry files. At time of writing there are some modified mdc\#-geane fcl files which can readily be used. Only the necessary straw geometry and associated mother volumes, as well as the parallel world dummy planes are necessary to fit tracks, though including other geometry can of course change particle behaviour. All 3 main trackers are included in their original positions, except possibly for the upcoming June commissioning run where only the 18th tracker should be included. 

    Fcl parameters exist for the StrawTrackerCadMesh\_service and Straws\_service in order to turn material on or off at will, ``materialTracker'' and ``strawMaterial'' respectively. The rest of the geometry has to be manually changed and rebuilt in order to remove material if one wishes. These include VacuumChamberCadMesh and the World, as well as the ``buildSupportPost'' option in strawtracker.fcl, ``buildTrolly'' in vac.fcl (where the associated material is hardcoded in), and ``trolleySupportMaterial,'' also in vac.fcl. One should make sure to perform reconstruction with the same material parameters as were used in the event generation for proper results. (These options are primarily for debugging the tracking. Close to perfect results have been shown for tracking within a vacuum world, \href{http://gm2-docdb.fnal.gov:8080/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=4876}{DocDB 4876} and \href{http://gm2-docdb.fnal.gov:8080/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=4894}{DocDB 4894}.)


    \subsection{Reconstruction Flow}

    The overall tracking infrastructure and reconstruction flow can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:Infrastructure}. Data comes from simulation or the real experiment, are turned into art objects upon which the gm2 framework acts, and are grouped based on their positions in space and time. The RunGeane.fcl file (detailed more below) performs the entire chain within the blue box in Figure \ref{fig:Infrastructure}, excepting the track extrapolation stage. Within the reconstruction flow objects called Track Candidates are produced, which are the input to the Geane fitting code. The Geane fitting specific flow can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:GeaneFlow}. 


\begin{figure}[]
\caption{Shown is the infrastructure flow for the entire track reconstruction chain. In the green blocks are the sources of track data to fit, either from Geant simulation, or real data. In blue is the offline reconstruction block. Straw digits are formed in the digitalization step, those are then calibrated and grouped into time islands, clusters, and seeds which then combine to form track candidates. It is these track candidates which are the input into the Geane fitting code (and other future fitting code). The fitting code then outputs tracks which the track extrapolation stage will run over. This picture is taken from one of Tammy's talks. Note that there is some iteration here that is not shown.}

\hspace{15mm}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{GeaneFlow}
\label{fig:GeaneFlow}
\end{figure}


    The primary code for the Geane fitting are the GeaneReco\_module.cc and GeaneFitter.cc files. Detailed information regarding all of these files is given below, but here is provided a shorter summary. Track candidates drop into the GeaneReco file which initially sets up both the Geant4 world and the error\_propagation routines (once for all events), creates a GEANEArtRecord, and fills relevant track fitting objects. GeaneReco then tracks particles along their average trajectories in the Geant4 world, producing the matrix objects necessary for fitting as described in the Formalism section. All of these objects are stored within the GEANEArtRecord, which is then passed to the GeaneFitter class, which contains all the methods and math needed for fitting the track again described in the Formalism section, after which a fit to the track is provided along with higher level track objects. GeaneFitter also provides an improvement to the track. GeaneReco and GeaneFitter then loop until the track fitting either succeeds or fails based on some metric, after which GeaneReco produces TrackArtRecords and TrackStateArtRecords, as well as a final updated GEANEArtRecord for the track. (Note that after a single iteration, one pass through GeaneReco and one pass through GeaneFitter, a $\chi^{2}$ and a fix for the track will be produced, but the track predicted parameters and objects will be based on the starting position and momentum guess before it has been updated, and so do not correspond to the fitted track. It's necessary to perform at least a second iteration for this reason, and is why no track converges under the strict criteria in under 3 iterations.) These TrackArtRecords can then pass to the extrapolation stage or go into some refinement stage (which has not been developed yet). The produced GEANEArtRecords can then be passed through filters and analyzers depending on what the user is investigating or looking at (again detailed below).


  \subsection{fcl File Specifics - RunGeane.fcl} 

    Again, reconstruction is performed using RunGeane.fcl in gm2tracker on the events generated from somewhere higher in the chain. It is important to explain some fcl parameters necessary for the reconstruction. First, there is a fcl parameter useSD to turn off the straw sensitive detectors so that in the reconstruction phase hits are not regenerated. If this is not included, it will default to true and cause crashes in the reconstruction. Secondly, the RunGeane.fcl file loads all 3 trackers necessary for symbol and name definitions, but such that tracker 0 is rotated such that the tracking planes are parallel to the global geant X axis (using the rotateArcTracker fcl parameter for the ArcService). This is done to avoid the issue of error propagation instability close to the Z axis, as detailed in \href{http://gm2-docdb.fnal.gov:8080/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=4567}{DocDB 4567}, while at the same time still observing the correct azimuthally symmetric 2D field for the tracks. Track hits are rotated from their separate trackers to this one tracker frame with the GeaneWorldTracker[0], GeaneWorldTracker[12], and GeaneWorldTracker[18] transforms defined at the bottom of StrawTrackerCadMesh\_service.cc, as detailed in the Coordinate Systems section. (In the future, if fields or geometries are not identical between trackers, the details here will have to be improved after changes have been made.) As a reminder there are material fcl parameters for the straws and straw trackers which should be the same as were used in the event generation. The RunGeane.fcl file also includes some analyzer and filter modules by default, which are detailed further below.

    All pieces of the chain before the track fitting (digitalizing, seeding, clustering, t0 finder, and track finding) are primarily just to take data and then group them into a format for the track fitting to act on. However it is also important to understand at some level the pieces of the chain before the Geane fitting and the different options which will affect the results. See a collaboration talk by Tammy, \href{http://gm2-docdb.fnal.gov:8080/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=5601}{DocDB 5601}, for some more information on this. Here is a short summary, not all method or file calls are detailed. Most of these files and parameters should be left unchanged unless one is familiar with the subject matter. 

    \begin{enumerate}

          \item{\bf{Digitalizer\_module.cc}} \\
          This module creates StrawDigits which will ultimately be combined to form the Track Candidates that the fitting will act over. It is the variables in this art record that are updated and correspond to real data, which straw was hit, the time of the hit, and the dca of the hit. The StrawDigits also contain a pointer to a struct of Monte-Carlo truth data, StrawMCDigit, which can also be accessed for track information. The Digitalizer module has several fcl parameters to change things like the gas drift time, drift model, allowing recorded negative times, and some particle cuts. By default it uses a Gaussian drift model which is called when the Digitalizer calls the DriftTimeModels.cc file, where it will gaussian smear the hit time from the MC digit time. These fcl parameters are located in digitalizerParams.fcl. The smearedDriftTimeSeed parameter should be set to 0 if one wants random results from run to run, which is necessary for grid jobs. Note that the dca error parameter is not currently filled correctly. 

          Also information relating to James' more realistic gas response/hit time generation has not been tested/understood/written about yet.

          \item{\bf{TimeIsland\_module.cc}} \\
          Groups the digits from the Digitalizer in time. Has some options for changing the time window width. fcl parameters are located in recoIslandParams.fcl.

          \item{\bf{ClusterFormation\_module.cc}} \\
          Groups neighboring digits in the same view to form clusters. fcl parameters are located in recoClusterParams.fcl.

          \item{\bf{T0Finder\_module.cc}} \\
          Calculates a t0 for the track. Has an option for which model to use for calculating said t0. The default is using truthData, which will change once real data is available - unclear to me at this moment what that will be. fcl parameters are located in recoT0FindingParams.fcl.

          \item{\bf{DriftDistanceCal\_module.cc}} \\
          Calculates the drift times and distances within the straws based on the calculated t0 from the previous module. Has options for different drift calculators and parameters, including a ``useTrueModuleT0'' parameter for using mc truth information. The drift time is calculated from the digit hit time (calculated in the Digitalizer) minus the module t0. If true t0 is not used, then the dca smearing will not be perfectly gaussian. fcl parameters are located in recoClusterParams.fcl.

          \item{\bf{SeedFormation\_module.cc}} \\
          Groups neighboring clusters in the same module to form seeds. fcl parameters are located in recoSeedParams.fcl.

          \item{bf{Aside}}
          It's important to note that there is another iteration of the time island and clustering modules which are improved now that better drift times and distances have been calculated from the previous modules, using the same fcl paramters.

          \item{\bf{TrackFinding\_module.cc}} \\
          Groups time islands and digits based on their positions in space. There are two finders available for use, fcl parameter trackFinderName, the Simple Track Finder (SimpleTrackFindingUtils.cc) and the Long Track Finder (LongTrackFindingUtils.cc). The former just runs off the generated time islands, and is more applicable to truth monte carlo data. If you use this, then the second clustering module and seed formation module can be left out of the reconstruction chain. The latter, Long Track Finder, forms track candidates based on combining seeds and is the default used. It also has stricter fcl conditions, such as a default cut of 6 or more planes hit for the track. Both finders make use of the SimpleCircleFitter.cc class which fits a circle to the U and V digit positions to calculate a starting position and momentum guess for the track, which is currently necessary for the Geane fitting. The Long Track Finder also has a least squares minimizer which is unimportant for the Geane fitting. There is also some functionality to make multiple track candidates from the same digits, which will be useful once real data is coming in. fcl parameters are located in recoFindingParams.fcl, which then also links to some other fcl files depending on the finder used.


    \end{enumerate}

  \subsection{geaneFitParams.fcl}

    Because the Geane track fitting is the subject of this document, it will go more into detail of the Geane fitter fcl parameters, located in the geaneFitParams.fcl file. Some of these parameters are very likely to change or disappear in the near future.

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item{\bf{module\_type}} \\
      The ordinary art producer parameter which tells art which cc file to run, this is always set to GeaneReco unless the filename changes.

      \item{\bf{G4EVERBOSE}} \\
      This parameter corresponds to the iverbose level present in the Geant4 error\_propagation files and can be manually set here, from 0 to 5. It is for the debugging of deeper level Geane fitting code. Note that unless Geant is compiled with the flag by the same name setting this verbose level will do nothing. Since currently we utilize our own slightly modified error\_propagation files copied into the artg4/gm2Geane directory, it would be possible to remove the dependencies on this Geant4 build flag. Since however this will slow down the tracking it is the current choice to leave them in. 

      \item{\bf{trackingVerbose}} \\
      Geant4 tracking verbose level, from 0 to 5. This is always available but should only be used for debugging.

      \item{\bf{sigmaU, sigmaV}} \\
      These are the Gaussian smearing error paramaters on all U and V measurements, units of mm. This is both a temporary measure until the dca errors are properly calculated and included in the straw digits, and for debugging. It is very important that this value be equal to the actual drift distance smearing introduced in the digitalizer, calculated from the drift velocity times the drift time resolution, both of which are located in strawCommonParams.fcl. Otherwise tracking results will be off. At some point each straw and measurement will have its own distinct measurement error, at which point this variable can be removed. (Of course when non-gaussian errors are included, the tracking results will be affected in a yet to be determined way.)

      \item{\bf{yPosChange, zPosChange, xMomChange, yMomChange, zMomChange}} \\
      These are the uniform smearing bounds for the starting position of the track from truth, units of mm and MeV. These are largely unused now since the circle fitter provides a level of smearing automatically when it's used, but should be kept for future debugging purposes.

      \item{\bf{numPassesWireFit, numPassesMainFit}} \\
      These are parameters currently unused in the current version of the code, which were used for the Left-Right sequence checking routines. numPassesWireFit were the number of passes that the track should be fit to the wire centers, before which the best sequences were passed to the main fit code which would iterate a number of times equal to numPassesMainFit. It was observed in the past that 2 passes for each of these was sufficient for good tracking results. In the near future the LR stuff will change in some undetermined way and so these parameters as well as the code they relate to might disappear or change.

      \item{\bf{matrixDebug}} \\
      This boolean paramater turns on and off the copious matrix debugging output, used for deep level debugging. Note that these outputs are included in the log file and the log file threshold needs to be set to ``DEBUG''. In the future it might be beneficial for speed reasons to remove completely these debugging outputs. This parameter should always be turned off if looking at a large number of events.

      \item{\bf{rseed, rseed2}} \\
      These are random number seeds for two random number generators in the GeaneReco file. The rseed parameter corresponds to the random smearing that the starting guess undergoes if the circle fitter is not used, where the position and momentum fcl parameters above are used. The rseed2 parameter corresponds to if the true U and V parameters for the dummy tracker planes is used, in which case they should be smeared. The default should be 0 for the root TRandoms unless one wants to reproduce results. These are largely unused but should maybe be kept for debugging purposes.

      \item{\bf{useTruthLeftRight}} \\
      This parameter sets whether to use the information from the tracker dummy planes to determine whether the particle went to the left or the right of the wire, resolving said ambiguity. It's default for now is true until the LR stuff is properly reincorporated. This fcl parameter combines with useDummyTruthUV below in a couple of different ways depending on how one wants to fit tracks. The most used case is useTruthLeftRight=true and useDummyTruthUV=false by far, and the other cases should probably also be stripped out once the LR stuff is taken care of.

      \item{\bf{convergenceCriteria}} \\
      This is a scalar convergence criteria telling whether the track fitting has been successful or not, with a default value of .1. As long as the current iteration $\chi^{2}$ minus the previous iteration $\chi^{2}$ is less than this value, the track is considered to have converged, otherwise it continues iterating until it succeeds, fails, or is manually cut off at a larger number of iterations.


      \item{\bf{useDummyTruthUV}} \\
      This fcl parameter allows one to use the true U and V values determined from the tracker dummy planes instead of the straw digits themselves. This is only active when set to true and useTruthLeftRight from above is also set to true, and largely unused. It should possibly be kept in for debugging purposes, or removed once the LR stuff is taken care of. At the very least the code should be cleared up.

      \item{\bf{useCircleGuess}} \\
      This boolean parameter tells the code whether to use the circle fitter results for the track starting guess or not, called in the track finding part of the chain. It's default should remain true unless one wants to return to the uniform starting parameter smearing for debugging purposes.

      \item{\bf{doWireFit}} \\
      This parameter allows one to perform the track fitting relative to the wire centers, instead of the measured UV positions or truth UV positions. useTruthLeftRight cannot be set to true at the same time as this otherwise it will throw an exception. If used this will also set the position meaurement errors to the diameter of the gas divided by the square root of 12, or the error for a uniform distribution. These errors will plug into the Gaussian $\chi^{2}$ algorithm which isn't exactly correct but should be an okay approximation. This will be useful when trying to fit to data as a first pass. (Note that this has been untested for a while, and it's possible it's not fully working.)



    \end{enumerate}


  \subsection{cc Files}

    Here will be given a summary of the different cc files used in the Geane track fitting as shown in Figure \ref{fig:GeaneFlow} and explained up above, as well as extensive detail where necessary. Note: Ignore copious LR ambiguity solving code for now. When last checked it was working pretty well but not perfectly, and it needs to be studied more. Many changes have been made to other code which will break the interfaces to the LR code as well. Also all of this LR stuff might be pulled out and placed into other tracking code modules before and after the GEANE code, but that is unclear.


    \begin{enumerate}

      \item{\bf{GeaneReco\_module.cc}} \\
      This file consists of the main code which sets up the GEANE track fitting, pulls in upstream data products, interfaces with both Geant4 and the gm2 art framework, outputs TrackStateArtRecords and TrackArtRecords for use downstream, as well as GEANEArtRecords to analyze. 

      It's methods consists of:

        \begin{itemize}

          \item{produce} \\
          General overriden produce method. Calls main track fitting code on an event by event basis. Produces data products for downstream use.

          \item{InitializeGEANE} \\
          Geant4 GEANE (error\_propagation) initialization method called by the constructor, once per run.

          \item{trackFitting} \\ 
          Sets up variables and objects for track fitting after reading in upstream data products (track candidates and dummy planes). Contains main track fitting iteration loops. Also contains complex L/R sequence checking routines which can be ignored for now (and probably need to be changed at some point).

          \item{modifyMeasuredParams} \\ 
          Short method for L/R sequence checking stuff, can be ignored for now. Modifies measured parameters based on particular sequence.

          \item{errorPropagation} \\ 
          This method tracks particles through the detector using Geant4 error propagation routines with the correct geometry and field. It builds transport matrices, error matrices, and predicted parameters which are the objects used for fitting the track. It tracks on a plane by plane and step by step basis. These routines can be used to track particles forwards and backwards, where the forwards tracking is used in the code. Changing to backwards tracking would be very non-trivial. Add more detail here later..

          \item{angleCorrection} \\
          Method to iteratively correct measured parameters from a radial DCA value to a U or V value based on the momentum of the track and approximating a constant field within the straw. Also corrects the errors using a simple straight line approximation which is good enough. See appendix section for more details on how this works.

        \end{itemize}

      \item{\bf{GeaneFitter.cc}} \\
      This file consists of the main track fitting chi2 algorithm. It multiplies measured parameters, predicted parameters, error matrices, and transport matrices together to produce a chi2 for the track and an improvement to the starting paramters. It also reads in the measured hits errors in order to properly fit the track. There is a fcl parameter matrixDebug which can be used to turn on or off the many large matrix cout debugging statements.

        \begin{itemize}

          \item{TrackCorrelation} \\
          The main matrix multiplication routines.

          \item{preSequenceChecking} \\
          A method in order to create a hybrid wire / U or V error matrix for L/R sequence checking. Only called once per event.

          \item{sequenceChecking} \\ 
          The main L/R sequence checking method for an individual event. This method is called many thousands of times as each U or V sequence is checked. Ignore for now.

          \item{convertTo} \\
          Some methods for converting Eigen 5 vectors from GeV cm to MeV mm and vice versa.

        \end{itemize}

      \item{\bf{GeanePlots\_module.cc}} \\
      The main analyzer/plotting module which runs on the output GEANEArtRecords produced upstream. This creates many plots including chi2 distributions, p value distributions, number of iterations, track parameter, residuals, pulls, etc. Truth information for these plots is currently necessary as written, but can be take out in the future for real data. There are some fcl paramters to make cuts on different parameters. There are also some other plotter modules which are similar but much reduced in scope. reference geanePlotsParams.fcl file here.

      \item{\bf{GEANESingleEventViewer\_module.cc}} \\
      include a plot or two of what the single event viewer can show, how to use it (specify events or not)

      \item{\bf{GEANEProcessSelection\_module.cc}} \\
      mention how this insn't fully devloped yet

      \item{\bf{GeaneFailedPlots\_module.cc}} \\
      explain failed plots mode, included plot

      \item{\bf{GeanePoorEvent\_module.cc}} \\
      selection on bad events and why

      \item{\bf{geane plots macro}} \\
      I think also include some notes about this guy

    \end{enumerate}


  \subsection{Other useful fcl files}

    There is a number of other fcl files which are currently included in gm2tracker which are useful for various analysis or fitting purposes. These are relatively simple and straight forward fcl files which can be deleted, combined, or changed however the user wishes depending on what they are looking at. They are typically used on produced sets of GEANEArtRecords.

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item{\bf{RefitGeane.fcl}} \\
      This file simply refits a previously produced set of track candidates, typically used for refitting failed or bad events from a previous attempt at fitting. One can make changes to the fitting code, refit, and compare to previous results.

      \item{\bf{makeGEANEPlots.fcl}} \\
      This file will call the main GeanePlots analyzer module for producing plots about the GEANEArtRecords, useful for when one wants to add or remove plots after tracks have already been produced.

      \item{\bf{ProcessSelectionGeane.fcl}} \\
      This file will call the filter on different physical processes that events have undergone within the tracker region, if one wishes to separate events based on this criteria.

      \item{\bf{makeGeaneSingleEvent.fcl}} \\
      This file will take produced GEANEArtRecords and call the single event analyzer on the specified set of events. This is useful for analyzing single events to see where rare errors crop up, if tracks are kinking, for debugging purposes, etc. This should not be used for a large number of events.

      \item{\bf{filterTracks.fcl}} \\
      This file will filter on whether art events successfully produced a GEANEArtRecord or not (succeeded or failed), which is useful for reducing the size of art files which contain many events that do not hit the tracker or don't hit enough planes.

      \item{\bf{fileMerge.fcl}} \\
      This very general file will simply combine the set of art files that are passed to it, useful for reducing the number of files one has to deal with.

    \end{enumerate}

\section{gm2Geane package in artg4 - eloss, brems, ionizations, msc}

See many docdbs by Nick Kinnaird on geane updates for more info if wanted. Summary of stuff here.


  There is a folder under artg4/gm2Geane, where slightly (but importantly) modified geant/geane code that the geane track fitting uses is located. Most importantly is that the reconstruction was taking too much energy away from the particle during propagation due to bremsstrahlung, so that has been removed. (Thanks James for help with this.) (Probably explain flow of file - extrapolator tables etc.).

  Besides those associated files, all files from the geant folder ``error\_propagation'' have been copied into this directory as well, with the only non-name changes lying in gm2GeaneFreeTrajState.cc. (Many files had to be copied due to naming/linking - some could probably have been omitted but I decided to copy the whole folder.) Ionization and multiple scattering errors have been modified according to Lavezzi thesis (explain more) - with no improvement in results unfortunately. (Probably turn defaults back to original code (still gm2Geane) with the option to turn things on somehow if desired - at least leave them in for future tuning.)

Should I go more in depth about the error\_propagation/gm2Geane source code? Probably - at least for certain main files.


Add many plots and pictures of things - pulls, single events, tracks, etc etc.

\begin{figure}[]
\caption{Shown here is the energy loss between the first and last hit in the tracker from simulation. (Momentum magnitude difference.) Sources of energy loss come from ionization and bremsstrahlung processes, which account for the long Landau tail running off to infinity. The distribution has a mean of approximately 220 keV and and peak centered at about 150 keV, which is reasonable for the material composition of our trackers and tracker gas. More than 50\% of the energy loss comes from the mylar walls of the straws as seen in the simulation.}

\begin{figure}[]
\caption{It was noticed during the course of debugging that the Geant4 error\_propagation routines were consistently removing too much energy on average from all tracks as they passed through the tracker during reconstruction. It was discovered that the Geant4 tables were taking out too much energy due to bremsstrahlung processes and it was decided to remove this effect. The left plot shows in a red the true particle momentum as a function of X distance through the tracker, and in black the reconstructed momentum before bremsstrahlung was taken out of the reconstruction for a single event. The differing slopes signify the problem. The right plot shows the same event but with bremsstrahlung taken out. Notice scale change, and that the reconstructed momentum aligns much more readily with the truth.}

\section{Coordinate Systems}

  The only material not covered here in full detail is the mathematical explanation of reference frames, for which one should see the reference papers. It suffices to summarize as follows: GEANE objects (matrices and parameter vectors) are defined and calculated in the Geant4 source code in the free particle system. Then there is an intermediate surface system defined in XYZ, as the Geant4 surface trajectory system must be defined in an orthogonal coordinate system, before which parameter objects are converted to the most natural detector system of XUV. (Important note - be very careful with coordinate system variables, letters are reused between different papers and code bases with different configurations and meanings constantly.)


\begin{figure}[]
\caption{Shown here is a picture of the 3 trackers in the world geometry in their approximate positions. First note the world coordinate system shown in the bottom left of the plot, where the origin lives at the center of the ring. Tracks are then generated and read out from the trackers in their three world positions in red. Due to the reconstruction bug where tracks improperly reconstruct if their momenta is too aligned with the globabl Z axis, the reconstruction rotates the entire arc including tracker 0 to the blue position, where planes are parallel in X, and this problem is avoided. Track parameters from the 3 positions are then rotated to this reference frame by the amounts shown on the plots for the reconstruction stage, and at the end are rotated back.}

\begin{figure}[]
\caption{This picture shows the coordinate system in which the the Geane track reconstruction is performed, in relation to the world coordinate system. The origin remains at the center of the ring, with the tracking planes parallel in X in the reconstruction, going forward in number. Y is vertically up, and Z is horizontally to the right. U and V are defined such that they have greater values with higher radii and increasing straw number.}

\section{notes and other}

 Due to the CBO of the beam, 1 tracker accounts for ~90\% of the physics, and a second tracker accounts for much of the remaining. (Find/learn sources for this to explain a bit better..)

  starting error matrix

  linking equations to code variables

  initial errors into tracing/error propagation?

  mention that it's possible to make a Kalman filter which uses the geane matrix objects? and that I didn't do so because we wanted two separate methods for the tracking originally and someone else was working on the kalman filter? (and the chi2 minimization was used in the last experiment)

  make a subsection on the left-right ambiguity work 

  negative chi2 stuff

  note on older branches for development at all?

  \subsection{Kalman Filter}

    There is some precedent for using the error propagation matrix objects within a Kalman filter as detailed in the Lavezzi thesis \cite{Lavezzi}, but due to the circumstances following the creation of this code that technique was not followed. At the beginning of development, a Kalman filter was being started in tandem by others, which has since fallen by the wayside. In order to have two separate methods for fitting however, the least squares global minimization was chosen. The simpler method was also chosen as the author was unfamiliar with track fitting and coding in general when beginning development.
