\begin{abstract}

    In this document I will detail the concepts and mathematics of GEANE track fitting, as well as it's implementation in the gm2 simulation framework for the Muon g-2 Experiment at Fermilab. I will also detail the pecularities and intricacies of the code. This is done both for documentation purposes as well as a precursor to sections of my future thesis. This document assumes some familiarity with art on part of the reader, though such knowledge is not necessary for many sections. Note that the tracking code and framework is in constant development, so the details contained here within may be outdated at time of reading. I've tried to be thorough in my descriptions, but it is possible that some finer points have been left out of this document.

Should I put an acknowledments section in? (Rob, Rob, James, Joe)
From a technical document perspective maybe not?
