      \section{fullSeqFit - Left Right Code}

      This fitting mode and associated code takes the longest time to fit a track, because it checks every single LR combination for all hits in order to find the best track. It starts by first doing a wire fit for all hit digits in order to get approximate track objects used for making initial guesses at how good different LR combinations are. Second, one can lock certain hits to left, right, or center depending on how the user is fitting (locking LR from known geometry, low dcas, etc), and the track fitting will loop over the remaining unknown sides.

      In Figure blah (which needs updating...)


      describe here all of the main left right stuff
