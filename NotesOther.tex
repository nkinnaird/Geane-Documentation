  note on older branches for development at all?



  \subsection{Kalman Filter}

    There is some precedent for using the error propagation matrix objects within a Kalman filter as detailed in the Lavezzi thesis \cite{Lavezzi}, but due to the circumstances following the creation of this code that technique was not followed. At the beginning of development, a Kalman filter was being started in tandem by others, which has since fallen by the wayside. One of reasons for choosing the least squares global minimization was in order to have two separate methods for fitting. The simpler method was also chosen as I was unfamiliar with track fitting and coding in general when beginning development. (The primary reason was the introduction by Rob Carey, who worked on the traceback in the E821 experiment.)






Where to structure this in the file?

Notes on coordinate systems I use - UV pointing outward vs XYZ, XUV x being forward, UVW in geante src, maybe IJK/TUV in one paper-prob not, GeaneTrackerWorld[0,12,18], rotateArcTracker (bit more specific), magnetic field access coordinates?, JacobianToUV
- this should be in coord sys file

accessing the field in a specific way
